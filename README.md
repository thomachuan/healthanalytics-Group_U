## Impact of Working Hours on Fertility Rate Analysis

Project Overview This project investigates the relationship between working hours and fertility rates among women using R statistical analysis while controlling for various socioeconomic factors.

### === Data Source ===

IPUMS USA dataset

Sample includes women aged 18-49

Key variables: number of children, working hours, income, age, and education level

# === Key Features ===

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Outlier removal using IQR method

Missing value handling

Variable transformation (log income)

Education level categorization

Statistical Analysis

Three progressive Poisson regression models:

Basic model (working hours + controls)

Age-squared model (non-linear age effects)

Full model (including income)

Heterogeneity analysis

Robust standard errors

Visualization

Distribution plots for key variables

Residual diagnostics

Relationship plots between variables
