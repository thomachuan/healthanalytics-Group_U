# Impact of Working Hours on Fertility Analysis

Project Overview This project investigates the relationship between working hours and fertility among women using R statistical analysis while controlling for various socioeconomic factors.

## === Description of Data ===

1. IPUMS series: We use the IPUMS USA dataset, which provides standardized individual-level information from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey. This dataset is well-suited for our analysis of working hours and fertility patterns among American women.

2. Years: We analyze data from the 2023. This recent timeframe allows us to examine current patterns of work-fertility relationships in the post-pandemic era.

3. How to access the data: The data can be accessed from IPUMS USA at the following link:
[https://usa.ipums.org/usa/](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group)

3. Key Variables:

    1. Fertility measure: Number of own children in household (NCHILD)
    2. Working hours: Usual hours worked per week (UHRSWORK)
    3. Control variables: Age (AGE), Education (EDUC), Total income (INCTOT)
    4. Other variables: Sex (SEX), Educational attainment (EDUCD)

## === Key Features ===

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1. Outlier removal using IQR method

2. Missing value handling

3. Variable transformation (log income)

4. Education level categorization

### Statistical Analysis

1. Three progressive Poisson regression models:

2. Basic model (working hours + controls)

3. Age-squared model (non-linear age effects)

4. Full model (including income)

5. Heterogeneity analysis

6. Robust standard errors

### Visualization

1. Distribution plots for key variables

2. Residual diagnostics

3. Relationship plots between variables
